I dislike Chrome's custom print dialog - I always end up clicking the use system print dialog button.

This kills Chrome's custom print dialog

    defaults write com.google.Chrome DisablePrintPreview -boolean true

I'm guessing (haven't tried) that you can reset with one of

    defaults write com.google.Chrome DisablePrintPreview -boolean false

or

    defaults delete com.google.Chrome DisablePrintPreview
