title: Something odd in iTunes7's download artwork algorithm

iTunes7 can grab artwork from the iTMS store for ripped CDs. All well and good - but something is odd with the algorithm to decide which artwork.

Take for example Queen Greatest Hits. If you click on the arrow by the side of the track to go to that track in the store then it gets it right. But - if you download the artwork it gives you Greatest Hits by Queen Ekanem.

I wonder why they don't use the same lookup as the "go to track in store" links?

And I wonder where on earth I'm supposed to report this?
