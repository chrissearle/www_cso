Have been running sendmail for a long time on woody. However - with the upgrade to sarge I've been taking a look at exim's configuration - since the sendmail config is a nightmare :)

Status so far

**Installation**

    apt-get install exim4-daemon-heavy

This got exim4 down and removed sendmail. No debconf prompts came up at all. Some searching in debian-user gave me

    dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config

Good start - got it listening on more than 127.0.0.1 and got the list of local names installed.

**Spamassassin**

I was using a sendmail milter to run spamassassin - for exim an apt-cache search gave me a hint

    apt-get install sa-exim

The /usr/share/doc/sa-exim/README.Debian is a good file to read.

**ClamAV**

Here's another useful link (good for the clamav stuff):

[http://koivi.com/exim4-config/](http://koivi.com/exim4-config/)

From this I took the following:

    apt-get install clamav-daemon spamassassin spamc

An addition that I discovered - you need to edit /etc/default/spamassassin and set ENABLED=1 or it won't even start.

Add the following to your /etc/exim4/conf.d/main/01_exim4-config_listmacrosdefs file:

    # This tells what virus scanner to user
    av_scanner = clamd:/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl
    # Slowing spammers down by holding their connection a bit
    TEERGRUBE = 60s</code>

Edit /etc/exim4/conf.d/acl/40_exim4-config_check_data to inlude the following before the "# accept otherwise" line:

    # Reject messages that have serious MIME errors.
    # This calls the demime condition again, but it
    # will return cached results.
    deny message = Serious MIME defect detected ($demime_reason)
    demime = *
    condition = ${if >{$demime_errorlevel}{2}{1}{0}}
    .ifdef TEERGRUBE
        delay = TEERGRUBE
    .endif
    # Reject file extensions used by worms.
    # Note that the extension list may be incomplete.
    deny message = This domain has a policy of not accepting certain types of attachments \
                   in mail as they may contain a virus.  This mail has a file with a .$found_extension \
                   attachment and is not accepted.  If you have a legitimate need to send \
                   this particular attachment, send it in a compressed archive, and it will \
                   then be forwarded to the recipient.
    demime = exe:com:vbs:bat:pif:scr
    .ifdef TEERGRUBE
        delay = TEERGRUBE
    .endif
    # Reject messages containing malware.
    deny message = This message contains a virus ($malware_name) and has been rejected
    malware = *
    .ifdef TEERGRUBE
        delay = TEERGRUBE
    .endif

Then, you also need to set access for ClamAV. The best way to handle this is to add the clamav user to the Debian-exim group and be sure that /etc/clamav/clamd.conf contains the following lines (on a fresh sarge install the clamd.conf part was already in place):

    User clamav
    AllowSupplementaryGroups

If you had to add these lines, a restart of ClamAV is necessary for the changes to take effect.

**Virtual domains**

This section is taken mostly verbatim from [Debian Administration](http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/140). This site is *highly* recommended for all debian administrators.


*  mkdir /etc/exim4/virtual
*  For each domain - create a file named after that domain - for example - for this domain I created a file called chrissearle.org
*  In each file - for each local user to be recognised - add <code>user : user@localhost</code>
*  In each file - for each remote user to be recognised (mail forwarding) - add user : user@remote.host.tld
*  At the end of each file - add a catchall address - * : catchalluser@localhost
*  In /etc/exim4/conf.d/main/01_exim4-config_listmacrosdef change the line starting domainlist list_domains with domainlist local_domains = @:localhost:dsearch;/etc/exim4/virtual
* Add /etc/exim4/conf.d/router/350_exim4-config_vdom_aliases containing

        vdom_aliases:
        driver = redirect
        allow_defer
        allow_fail
        domains = dsearch;/etc/exim4/virtual
        data = ${expand:${lookup{$local_part}lsearch*@{/etc/exim4/virtual/$domain}}}
        retry_use_local_part
        pipe_transport   = address_pipe
        file_transport   = address_file
        no_more

Here I have assumed that either exim will go through a given virtual file - and send mail to the first matching address - so that the catchall address at the end gets everything that *isn't already sent somehwhere else* or that the * match is special and will only trigger if the mail isn't already handled (regardless of line order in the file). Whichever of these is correct - I find the files more readable with the catchall at the end. Time/the documentation will show if this assumption is correct. It's similar to the virtual user handling in sendmail.

I have also assumed that all mailman addresses will be in their respective virtual file _and_ in /etc/aliases (where you add the pipe to the mailman programs). Maybe the mailman stuff should be in these files - I'll update this when I find out.

**SMTP AUTH**

One of the main users is on a BT Yahoo broadband. I never managed to get any kind of SMTP AUTH or POP-before-SMTP or anything working with sendmail. So I cheated and opened for relaying from BT.  We got away with it for slightly over a year but last weekend the server was found and began to send so much spam that it died. So - that route is out.

Now - at the same time we're setting up a sarge box with exim - so - let's get SMTP AUTH working.

I'm going to start with PLAIN and LOGIN - we can look at other ones and SSL later. One step at a time.

First - I installed the following: 

    apt-get install courier-authdaemon courier-imap courier-pop

For SSL when I get that far we'll add

    apt-get install courier-imap-ssl courier-pop-ssl

courier-authdaemon is by default set up to use pam - that'll do for now.

In /etc/exim4/conf.d/auth/30_exim4-config_examples comment out the active plain: and login: sections

Add to a new file /etc/exim4/conf.d/auth/15_exim4-config

Update - it seems that the conf.d files are read in alphabetical order across the conf.d subdirectories - not within - it may be that this file would be better named 30_exim4-config or similar. You could always edit these sections into the examples file - but - I felt that examples were examples :)

    # Unix clients
    plain:  
        driver = plaintext
        public_name = PLAIN
        server_condition = \
                ${if eq {${readsocket{/var/run/courier/authdaemon/socket}\
                {AUTH ${strlen:exim\nlogin\n$2\n$3\n}\nexim\nlogin\n$2\n$3\n}}}{FAIL\n} {no}{yes}}
        server_set_id = $2
    # Windows clients
    login:
        driver = plaintext
        public_name = LOGIN
        server_prompts = Username:: : Password::
        server_condition = ${if eq {${readsocket{/var/run/courier/authdaemon/socket} \
                 {AUTH ${strlen:exim\nlogin\n$1\n$2\n}\nexim\nlogin\n$1\n$2\n}}}{FAIL\n} {no}{yes}}
        server_set_id = $1

This code snippet I found on the net - but I've lost the URL - so - if it's yours please let me know so I can credit.

Now - /var/run/courier/authdaemon is not readable by anything other than daemon user and daemon group. The socket is rwx for everyone. I've chosen to add Debian-exim4 user to the daemon group rather than edit the permissions on the authdaemon directory - I'm not sure if this is the best. It is necessary that exim can read/write to that socket.

Restart exim and try the following (you will need to type the telnet, EHLO and QUIT lines):

    telnet localhost 25
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.localdomain.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    220 server.domain.tld ESMTP Exim 4.50 Thu, 19 May 2005 20:15:15 +0200
    EHLO foo
    250-server.domain.tld Hello chris at localhost [127.0.0.1]
    250-SIZE 52428800
    250-PIPELINING
    250-AUTH PLAIN LOGIN
    250 HELP
    QUIT

So - AUTH is supported - plain and login - good.

Now - for testing - it was easy to add to change the /etc/default/exim4 file so that COMMONOPTIONS was set to -d-all+auth

Restarting exim4 with this in place will give debug output for auth related things. It won't background as a daemon - but that doesn't matter for testing.

In Outlook outgoing mail was set to require login and to use the same username/password as incoming (POP3 or IMAP). Sent a mail and presto - it went thru using the LOGIN auth (as could be seen in the debug log).

So - I've removed the debug options and restarted - later we'll be trying to add SSL and maybe some other options (although I'm not sure what Outlook supports other than login).

**RBL blacklists**

You'll need to edit /etc/exim4/conf.d/acl/30_exim4-config_check_rcpt

Find the section with the text

    #############################################################################
    # There are no checks on DNS "black" lists because the domains that contain
    # these lists are changing all the time. You can find examples of
    # how to use dnslists in /usr/share/doc/exim4-config/examples/acl
    #############################################################################

And look in the example file in the directory listed for examples. Simple :) However - this is just warnings. My old server is stricter - and rejects. This can be done by adding acl rules of the form

    deny dnslists = dnsbl.njabl.org

**Recommended Reading**

Loads of stuff on [http://www.debian-administration.org](http://www.debian-administration.org) - simply run a search for exim.

As I get the system more up and running I'll add to this article. Things on the wishlist

*  mailman (as in the config at [http://www.exim.org/howto/mailman21.html](http://www.exim.org/howto/mailman21.html) rather than the simple adding of aliases to /etc/aliases)
*  SSL
*  LDAP instead of PAM auth
*  Mail2News gateway
*  Getting my home machine to use this box as a smarthost (or whatever is most appropriate) so that my mail isn't rejected as coming from an ISP block.
