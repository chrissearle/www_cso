All you need to know is found here [http://deb.riseup.net/storage/encryption/dmcrypt/](http://deb.riseup.net/storage/encryption/dmcrypt/)

**Comments**

*  Stock debian 2.6 kernel works just fine
*  Stock debian kernel is modular - so looking in /proc/crypto before you start won't show aes, and dmsetup targets won't show crypto
*  Here - I'm adding an lvm2 partition for this (the comments at the end of the above link about lvm are about putting lvm pv's onto a crypt partition - here I have a crypt partition on top of lvm - so the comments do not apply)
*  On a different machine I've used a partition on an USB external harddisk which works too (you will need to remount if you unplug the USB and replug while mounted)
*  The above link has details of using loopback too

Code executed:

    aptitude install dmsetup cryptsetup
    lvcreate -L 1G -n crypt vg
    cryptsetup -y create private /dev/mapper/vg0-crypt
    mkfs -t xfs /dev/mapper/private
    mkdir /mnt/private

Two new scripts (I do not want the partition automounted):

*mount_private:*

    #!/bin/bash
    if [ -b /dev/mapper/private ]; then
      cryptsetup remove private
    fi
    cryptsetup create private /dev/mapper/vg0-crypt
    mount -t xfs /dev/mapper/private /mnt/private

*umount_private:*

    #!/bin/bash
    umount /mnt/private
    cryptsetup remove private
