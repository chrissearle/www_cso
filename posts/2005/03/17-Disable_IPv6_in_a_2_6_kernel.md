Debian linux running a 2.6 kernel

To disable IPv6 you need both the following lines in your /etc/modprobe.conf file

    alias ipv6 off
    alias net-pf-10 off

Thanks to the guys on the #debian freenode channel for help with this.

**Update**

Moved the config to /etc/modprobe.d/local

**Update**

This stopped working on 2.6.18 on debian etch. Now my /etc/modprobe.d/local now contains just

    blacklist ipv6

Apparently - in some cases this may still not work - in that case it is possible to try

    install ipv6 /bin/true
