## Tunnel configuration

Sign up for an account at [tunnelbroker](http://tunnelbroker.net)

Once signed up - choose *Create Regular Tunnel*

Enter the IPv4 address of the external interface of your firewall. Note - this must be able to receive and respond to ping from arc.he.net - the webpage will give you an IP address to allow ping for if it can't ping your firewall.

## Firewall configuration (debian lenny)

I had to open for incoming ping from he.net

    iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -s 66.220.2.74 -d 0/0 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

If your OUTPUT policy is not ACCEPT and doesn't allow ping then you may have to add some stuff there too.

You will need to forward protocol 41 to your inside box (my desktop is on the internal 192.168.1 network):

    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p 41 -j DNAT --to 192.168.1.x
    iptables -t filter -A FORWARD -i eth0 -p 41 -d 192.168.1.x -j ACCEPT

## Client configuration (Mac Snow Leopard)

Head to [pugio.net](http://pugio.net/2009/01/enable-ipv6-on-mac-os-x-the-tu.html) - there is a shell script to enable the interface and a launchctl plist to enable at launch

## Test

Test with ping6 - for example:

    chris$ ping6 pugio.net 
    PING6(56=40+8+8 bytes) 2001:xxxxxxxxxxxx --> 2002:4540:22b0::1
    16 bytes from 2002:4540:22b0::1, icmp_seq=0 hlim=56 time=231.701 ms
    16 bytes from 2002:4540:22b0::1, icmp_seq=1 hlim=56 time=209.833 ms
    ^C
    --- pugio.net ping6 statistics ---
    3 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 33.3% packet loss
    round-trip min/avg/max/std-dev = 209.833/220.767/231.701/10.934 ms
