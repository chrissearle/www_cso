Tried to load a new month card onto my flexus card this morning. The ticket machine at Blindern was "Not in use" - but the one at Forskningsparken was active.

Insert flexus card - order a month card - adult price - pay by card.

Swipe the bank card and enter PIN - payment terminal says "Godkjent" (approved).

Ticket machine says "Betaling avvist" (payment refused).

Nothing Trafikanten can do until the payment goes from an anonymous reservation on my account to an actual transaction - and it's going to take another visit to Trafikanten in the centre of town too.

Not exactly the best experience.
