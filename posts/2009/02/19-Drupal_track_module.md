The [track module](http://drupal.org/project/track) seems to have woken up ;)

Work on a 6.x version is progressing here: [http://drupal.org/node/367448](http://drupal.org/node/367448)

And once that is up we may also get waypoints: [http://drupal.org/node/135725](http://drupal.org/node/135725)

So - rather than working on a replacement of the geocaching module - perhaps track can take over.
