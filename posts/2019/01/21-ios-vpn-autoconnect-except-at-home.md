I was recently looking for a solution to the following question:

_How can I get my iPhone to always connect to my VPN except when at home?_

This led to [this article](https://thomas-witt.com/auto-connect-your-ios-device-to-a-vpn-when-joining-an-unknown-wifi-d1df8100c4ba) from Thomas Witt discussing how to do this with a profile.

This in turn linked to this very simple [github repository](https://github.com/klinquist/iOS-VPN-Autoconnect) with a generator for L2TP profiles.

Have generated, installed and tested - and it works just as I want it to :)
