Hmm - found today that my pulse elite headset wouldn't connect to the PS3. I don't use it often - so no idea when it last worked.

Reset method is a pin in the dongle for one sec then hold the vss/mode/mic mute buttons in while you turn on the headset - but it didn't help.

The really odd thing was that the headset stayed in connecting mode (2 rapid blue blinks every couple of secs **even when you turn it off**)

I've found exactly one post on the 'net that describes it:

So - let's see if draining the battery helps.
