The new firewall box is now bootable to OpenBSD 3.6. It boots from compact flash to mfs.

Waiting for a second IDE-CF converter - the H instead of the V (connectors horizontal instead of vertical - so I can shut the case).

Waiting to get a few missing packages installed - then it will replace the old box. Can't wait. Much much quieter :-)
