Looking at setting up a MythTV box ([MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org))

Normal questions - what hardware to get - why can't you get motherboards without inbuilt sound/screen/net etc etc.

Could be fun - so far it may look like

* 2.x+ GHz processor
* 2 or 3 250 Gb disks (maybe time to learn lvm?)
* Hauppauge 350 encoder/decoder card (1 or 2)

Not sure about graphics card or sound card just yet.

Longer term - add a DVD burner :-)
