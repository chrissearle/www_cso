title: New firewall?

Currently running an OpenBSD box as firewall on an old slow desktop box that's very noisy. Thinking of changing to mini-itx format.

Probably:


*  [Compact Flash IDE Adapter - V1](http://linitx.com/product_info.php?products_id=22)
*  [VIA EPIA PD6000 Mainboard](http://linitx.com/product_info.php?products_id=469)
*  [Cubid 3677 - Black](http://linitx.com/product_info.php?cPath=8_68&products_id=291)


Note - I'm intending to use the fanless Eden CPU rather than the C3 fanned CPU. The box has a small fan - but - if this is noisy I can replace this with a quiet fan.

Then all I need is a 256Mb DDR and a CF card - and since the card will be read-only - doesn't even have to be fast.

Thanks to Marius at [Conduct](http://www.conduct.no) for all his advice on this project :-)

Update 12/01 - parts ordered
Update 13/01 - parts arrived - and that was with 48 hour delivery! Very good status e-mails from LinITX too.
