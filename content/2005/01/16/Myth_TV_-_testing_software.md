Testing some of the software that Myth TV uses. XML TV for Norway is currently broken in the release version - but the CVS version of the grabber seems to be sorted.

So - how to make a box that is powerful enough but quiet enough? Some of the mini-itx boards look good - but - not enough slots - so ... how to decide what the hardware should actually be?
