Just been looking at the usage of the iPhone/iPad app for this year's JavaZone for the actual conference days.

* Yesterday (day 1) we had 820 users
* Today (day 2) we had 716
* Over the two days - the app was started 25631 times
* Unhandled errors causing a full application crash (unable to write to database, some other unexpected state etc) - 6 times.

Sessions divided by model:
