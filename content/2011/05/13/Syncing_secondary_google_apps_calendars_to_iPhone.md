See [CalDAV/CardDAV](/2012/12/17/Google_apps_removing_EAS_support_-_moving_to_CalDAV_CardDAV) for info on switching to a CalDAV/CardDAV setup.  

## Original Post

Setting up calendars to sync from google apps to iOS turned out to be harder than I expected.

I had already set up a gmail iOS mail/cal/contacts account on the iPhone. But that only gets the primary calendar.

[Calendar & Contacts Sync: Choosing Which Calendars to Sync](http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/,http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=139206) talks about going to m.google.com/sync - but that just throws back that this isn't supported on your phone.

[Google Sync: Set Up Your Apple Device for Google Sync](http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138740&topic=14252) suggests to use an exchange account instead. This didn't seem to help.

However - after a lot of wandering thru the forums I stumbled across this link:

[http://www.google.com/calendar/iphoneselect](http://www.google.com/calendar/iphoneselect)

When I logged in there - it listed all my google calendars. I then simply checked them off and they then just turned up on my iPhone as expected.
