title: Exim4 shouldn't give up just because clamav died

I was having the issue that if clamav died (usually due to freshclam update taking too long) that exim4 would start temporary rejecting ALL mail.

Here's a suggestion from Mike Cardwell on the exim users mailing list. It adds a check on the file existing and adds a header if not instead of rejecting.

    warn !condition = ${if exists{/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl}}
         add_header = X-Virus-Checked: False
    deny condition  = ${if exists{/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl}}
         malware    = *
