Well - this machine is now running on a 2.2 GHz Athlon-64 3500 with 2Gb RAM - instead of the old 700MHz PIII. As part of this the box is now primarily registered in the chrissearle.org domain - longship.org now CNAME aliases to it. The chrissearle.org domain naming got changed over from dilbert to racing gigs from the Isles of Scilly - so - I'm hoping that I haven't screwed the DNS too much :)

If you notice things (mail/web etc) not working as expected - then do let me know.
