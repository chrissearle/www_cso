For a long while this site has been running a combination of wordpress with embedded gallery2 (using the wpg2 plugin).

On wednesday the process of migrating it to drupal again with gallery2 embedded (using the gallery plugin) started - and it's gone surprisingly quickly.

Within a few days I expect to have the last changes made and the site moved over.

Things left to do

*  Do I like this theme or should I theme it myself?
*  Get the tinymce g2image plugin to work (generate the correct links)
