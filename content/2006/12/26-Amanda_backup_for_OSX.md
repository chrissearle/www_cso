I needed to get both my Mac machines (mac mini intel and macbook pro) to be included in the amanda backup I run.

I could have tried going via samba - but the following page works exactly as advertised:

Notes - I used the latest stable build as of today: 2.5.1p2. One oddity in configure (a call to head with unknown params) - but it all worked. I also had to use the username backup in the .amandahosts file since that is the user the tape server uses - this is only the .amandahosts file - the rest is using the amanda user as per the article.
