LDAP authentication started giving:

    (9)Bad file descriptor: Could not open password file: (null)

This is because apache 2.2 needs to be told what provider.

Add:

    AuthBasicProvider ldap

In addition - to be allowed to use require valid-user add:

    AuthzLDAPAuthoritative off

So - in full - the old config:

    <Location /location>
      AuthName "Auth NAme"
      AuthType Basic
      AuthLDAPURL ldap://host:port/basedn?attribute
      require valid-user
    </Location>

changes to

    <Location /location>
      AuthName "Auth NAme"
      AuthType Basic
      AuthBasicProvider ldap
      AuthzLDAPAuthoritative off
      AuthLDAPURL ldap://host:port/basedn?attribute
      require valid-user
    </Location>
