[fink](http://fink.sf.net) update was failing with the following error about head missing a -n option:

    cc1plus: warning: "-Wbad-function-cast" is valid for C/ObjC but not for 
     C++
     cursesfile=`echo "#include <curses.h>" | \

           sed -e "s/^[^"]*"//; s/".*$//"`; \
     if [ "$cursesfile" = "" ]; then echo "can"t find curses file"; exit 1; 
     fi; \

     can"t find curses file

It turns out that the issue is that when you install perl LWP it installs HEAD, GET and POST into /usr/bin. Mac OSX uses HFS+ which is case insensitive - this then overwrites the normal head utility.

I moved the HEAD/GET/POST utilities to /usr/local/bin and grabbed the head utility from a different mac box - this solved the problem.
