The n95 from nokia is not directly supported by mac osx. However - there are two additions that will help.

**iSync**

Nokia themselves provide an iSync plugin that will give you full syncing of iCal and Address Book. More info [available from Nokia](http://europe.nokia.com/A4299040)

**Address Book pairing**

This is not sync - but the ability to send SMS, and receive incoming call notifications via bluetooth. You'll need a plugin to Address Book - available from [Nova Media](http://www.novamedia.de/e_pages/e_produkte_mac_ab_plugin.html). Note - outgoing SMS works fine, incoming call notification and ability to answer with SMS also work fine - but incoming SMS does not. This is apparently due to Nokia and the phone - it doesn't support this according to Nova Media.

**3G over bluetooth**

This does work - but the configuration scripts are not part of osx. You'll need to grab them from [Taniwha](http://www.taniwha.org.uk/)
