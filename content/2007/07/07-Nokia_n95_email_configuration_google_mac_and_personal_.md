1.  Back > Outgoing
1.  Username/password as for incoming, security TLS/SSL port 25
1.  Back > Back > User settings
1.  Enter your Name as you want to display

Personal server (debian etch):

This is talking to a courier imap with ssl (OpenSSL) and exim4 (GnuTLS)

The settings are all the same as above (replace user, pass and host etc as needed).

For secure IMAP or POP3 - just choose SSL/TLS. Self-generated certificate gives a warning on the phone but you can choose to continue.

NOTE: At present the n95 refuses to talk SSMTP to the exim4 server. Doesn't matter if I use StartTLS, SSL/TLS and whatever port. It just gives a long long wait at Connecting to mailbox 'mailbox name' followed by a General - Operation timed out error message.

I wonder if this is like the SonyEricsson p990i that could talk OpenSSL but not GnuTLS. But nothing is logged on the server at all :(
