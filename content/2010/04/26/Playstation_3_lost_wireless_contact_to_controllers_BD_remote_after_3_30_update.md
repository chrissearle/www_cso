Just updated the 120Gb slim PS3 to the latest 3.30 update.

After the update neither of the sixaxis controllers or the BD remote could get any kind of response wirelessly. The controllers worked fine over USB.

No reset seemed to help.

However - the following worked fine.

* Turn off PS3
* Unplug
* Wait 10 secs
* Replug and boot
* Press PS button on controller over USB to sync
* Remove controller and press PS button to get a wireless connection
* Repeat with second controller
* Use system menu to re-attach BD remote as if it were a new remote.

Now all three are working again.
