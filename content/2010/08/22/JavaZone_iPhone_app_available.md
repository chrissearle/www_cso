My first iPhone app - for [JavaZone 2010](http://jz10.java.no) is now available via the [app store](http://itunes.apple.com/app/javazone/id384888388?mt=8).

JavaZone 2010 runs from 8th-9th September 2010 in the Oslo Spektrum.

This app provides access to the agenda for JavaZone and allows the user to mark sessions as favourites which can then be viewed separately (this can be used e.g. as My Programme or similar).

More information on JavaZone: [http://www.javazone.no](http://www.javazone.no) or you can head straight for the [programme](http://javazone.no/incogito10/events/JavaZone%202010/sessions)
