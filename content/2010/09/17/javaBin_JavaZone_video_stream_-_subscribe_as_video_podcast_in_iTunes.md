## Update

All videos are now pushed to [JavaZone talks](http://video.javazone.no/)

## Original Post

The JavaZone 2010 videos have been released and are available on [http://streaming.java.no](http://streaming.java.no).

If you want to add them to iTunes - they're not available in the iTunes store - but you can add them easily by hand.

Grab the feed URL ([http://streaming.java.no/tcs/rss.php](http://streaming.java.no/tcs/rss.php)) - head to iTunes, and choose advanced > subscribe to podcast and paste the feed in. Simple ;)
