There's an interesting paragraph in the latest Mac OS X Java update relasenotes [New and Noteworthy](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#releasenotes/Java/JavaSnowLeopardUpdate3LeopardUpdate8RN/NewandNoteworthy/NewandNoteworthy.html) - a paragraph called "Java Deprecation".

I don't think this link is NDA'd outside of apple's developer program - it seems publicly available at least.

<blockquote>As of the release of Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 3, the version of Java that is ported by Apple, and that ships with Mac OS X, is deprecated.

This means that the Apple-produced runtime will not be maintained at the same level, and may be removed from future versions of Mac OS X. The Java runtime shipping in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, and Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, will continue to be supported and maintained through the standard support cycles of those products.</blockquote>

What does this in fact mean? I'm not sure. Does it mean no java in Mac OS X Lion? Does it mean that apple now expect us to move to OpenJDK? Or will Oracle/Sun start developing a mac version in the same way as they provided windows, solaris and linux?

We'll have to see if more info comes out - perhaps on the mac java mailing list.
