A follow up on [Java deprecated on Mac OS X](/2010/10/21/java-deprecated-on-mac-os-x)

From a response in [this thread](http://lists.apple.com/archives/Java-dev/2010/Oct/msg00121.html) we can read:

<blockquote>
Apps that use deprecated or optionally installed technologies (e.g., Java, [PowerPC code requiring] Rosetta) will be rejected.
</blockquote>
