Steps to confuse a flexus card.

1. Have a ticket due to run out at 21:39 2nd feb
2. Add a new 30 day ticket on the 1st feb
3. Go to Ullevål Stadion on the 2nd at about 19:00
4. All validating machines "No valid ticket on card"
5. Payment machine shows both active ticket and new ticket and can in fact print out a receipt showing so

And there we have it - I'm confused.
