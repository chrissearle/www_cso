An update to [iPhone 3.0 firmware release and stereo bluetooth - missing AVRCP](/2009/06/25/iPhone_3_0_firmware_release_and_stereo_bluetooth_-_missing_AVRCP)

It turns out that the iPhone does support AVRCP - that's giving us the play/pause functionality.

But - in this [support article](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3647) it says:

> iPhone and iPod touch (2nd generation) support pause, play, and stop for AVRCP

So - apple have implemented AVRCP - but just not all of it.

From the support article there is no indication if this is going to get updated - so I guess we'll just have to hope.

**Update on AVRCP**

As of iOS 4.1 the AVRCP support now includes ff/rw and next/prev so it looks like a complete support for AVRCP from that version.
