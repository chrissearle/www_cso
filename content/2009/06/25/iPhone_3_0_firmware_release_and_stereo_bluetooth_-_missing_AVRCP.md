Wildly irritating.

Apple have added A2DP (stereo music) over bluetooth.

Time to grab that bluetooth adapter I stopped using after getting an iPhone from work.

Hang on - the scan/skip buttons (fast forward/rewind/change track) don't work.

I'm astounded that Apple have included support for A2DP without AVRCP (AVRCP is the profile for these skip/scan buttons).

You get a stereo bluetooth adapter to avoid having to have cables and to keep the phone packed away in a pocket or bag. But with this omission you can't really control the phone - just start/stop and volume.

Really hope that it was an omission rather than a concrete descision.
